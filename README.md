# JS Website Builder

**JS Website Builder** is a dynamic web page constructor built with pure JavaScript. It provides a real-world example of modern web development practices, including modular JavaScript, CSS styling, DOM manipulation, and project bundling with Parcel. This project is designed as a learning tool to enhance coding skills and create responsive, customizable web pages.

## Skills Learned and Technologies Used

### JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Learned to dynamically generate HTML templates and insert them into the DOM using JavaScript.
- **Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilized ES6 classes for modular and reusable code. Applied the **Open-Closed Principle** to make components extensible without modifying existing code.
- **Event Handling**: Managed DOM events such as form submissions, clicks, and rendering processes efficiently.
- **Template Literals**: Used template literals for generating complex HTML structures with dynamic data.

### HTML and CSS
- **Responsive Design**: Built and styled layouts for blocks such as headers, images, and text to ensure a visually appealing interface across devices.
- **Styling Optimization**: Organized CSS files for scalability and optimized styles for better performance.
- **Custom Styling for Components**: Applied styles dynamically to blocks through JavaScript.

### Project Tooling and Bundling
- **Node.js and npm**: Used Node.js for dependency management and installed required packages such as Parcel for bundling.
- **Parcel Bundler**: Learned to configure Parcel for development and production modes, including hot module reloading.
- **File Organization**: Created a structured project hierarchy with separate directories for assets, styles, and reusable components.

### Best Practices in Development
- **Code Optimization**: Iteratively improved and refactored code to enhance readability, maintainability, and performance.
- **Reusability**: Decomposed code into smaller, modular utilities and components.
- **Abstraction**: Abstracted repetitive logic into reusable functions and classes.

### Advanced Concepts
- **Rendering Models**: Designed a model for managing content blocks and dynamically creating HTML structures based on user inputs.
- **Working with Callbacks and Context**: Managed callbacks for interactivity and ensured proper handling of the `this` context in event listeners.
- **Form Data Handling**: Processed user input data efficiently to dynamically generate content.
